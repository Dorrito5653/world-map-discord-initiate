# world-map-discord-initiate

Here me and some other contributors work on making a website game with discord presence involved
We have a long list of policies including multiple counts of misuse of action towards reviving our discord server and actually getting a life. I am just kidding there is no policy enjoy life because we have no time to write one.

# How to use
1. Clone this repo
2. To the dotenv add `DBTOKEN=your_mongodb_collection_string`
3. Make some collections to store things like login info player stats and more.
4. Do ```npm i mongoose``` in the terminal 
5. Open the html file and use it
