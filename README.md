# world-map-discord-initiate

Here me and some other contributors work on making a website game with discord presence involved
We have a long list of policies including multiple counts of misuse of action towards reviving our discord server and actually getting a life. I am just kidding there is no policy enjoy life because we have no time to write one.

# How to use

- You will need a mongodb account and a database on it for this to work

Step 2: Add a file called `.env` then add `DBTOKEN=your_mongodb_collection_string` to the file

Step 3: Make a collection called "accounts" in the mongodb database

Step 4: Install required packages using
