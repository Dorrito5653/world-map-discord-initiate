# world-map-discord-initiate

Here me and some other contributors work on making a website game with discord presence involved
We have a long list of policies including multiple counts of misuse of action towards reviving our discord server and actually getting a life. I am just kidding there is no policy enjoy life because we have no time to write one.

How to use
#1: Clone this repo
#2: To the dotenv add your own mongodb cluster string and add some collections
#3: Open the html file and use it
